# Tokenized Property Rental Platform

Welcome to our **tokenized property rental platform** with blockchain technology. This project enables the tokenization of properties, offering more flexibility and security to users. Additionally, we've integrated a feature for travelers to find travel companions via **Talent Protocol**, We also integrate a Swap with a token finder across the blockchain, a bridge, real state fractionation, and a token search engine.

## Key Features

- **Property Tokenization**: Each property is backed by a token, ensuring security and authenticity on the **Base** blockchain.
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Users can rent properties using digital assets in a secure and seamless way.
- **Travel Companion Matching**: Through our integration with **Talent Protocol**, users can find travel companions who share similar interests and goals.
- **100 Real Properties**: We have an initial inventory of 100 real-world properties ready to be listed for rentals.
- **Full Transparency on Blockchain**: All property, rental, and transaction data is publicly verifiable on the Base blockchain.
- **Bridge, Swap, and Onramp**: Our platform integrates **Base ENS** names with a **bridge, swap**, and **onramp** provided by **OnchainKit**, allowing users to seamlessly interact with multiple chains.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain**: Base
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Reown, Tailwind
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, ERC20, ERC721 for tokenization
- **Talent Protocol**: To connect travelers
- **OnchainKit**: For swap, and onramp functionality, token chip, Ens Name, Identity, Coin Base Wallet

## Roadmap

1. **Property Launch**: We are launching the first batch of 100 real-world tokenized properties for rentals.
2. **Inventory Expansion**: As we grow, more tokenized properties will be added.
3. **Funding Strategy**: We are currently seeking investors and partners interested in scaling this decentralized rental ecosystem.
